# **HiParis_Fire_Detection**  
## **Fire Detection using YOLOv8**

### **Introduction**
This project focuses on detecting **smoke and fire** in forest environments using advanced object detection techniques. Various models were explored, including **YOLOv5**, **Faster R-CNN**, and **YOLOv8**. After rigorous testing, **YOLOv8** was selected for its **superior speed and accuracy**, making it the optimal choice for real-time fire detection in complex environments.

The model was trained on a specialized dataset containing labeled images of **forest fires**, enabling it to efficiently detect early signs of fire outbreaksâ€”crucial for preventing large-scale forest fires.
